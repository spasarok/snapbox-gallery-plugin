# About Snapbox Gallery Plugin
Snapbox replaces the default WordPress gallery with a snappy and responsive lightbox gallery.

# Why?
Clicking a thumbnail in the default WordPress gallery takes you to that thumbnail's media page.
Clicking a thumbnail in the Snapbox gallery brings up a lightbox on the current page instead.
The lightbox's next and previous images are always preloaded for snappy image transitions.
Now viewers can easily browse full-size images without needed to load every image, and without needing to leave the page.
